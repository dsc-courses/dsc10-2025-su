    "The **winning numbers** are chosen by King Triton, who draws five balls, one at a time, **without replacement**, from a pot of white balls numbered 1 to 66. Then, he draws a gold ball, the Tritonball, from a pot of gold balls numbered 1 to 15. Both pots are completely separate, hence the different ball colors. For example, maybe the winning numbers are (65, 9, 24, 23, 1, 9).\n",

    "We’ll assume for this problem that in order to win the grand prize (free housing), all six of your numbers need to match the winning numbers and be in the **exact same positions**. In other words, your entire sequence of numbers must be exactly the same as King Triton's sequence of winning numbers. However, if some numbers in your sequence match up with the corresponding number in the winning sequence, you will still win some Triton Cash. \n",

To encourage more students to buy Spirit Night Lotto tickets despite the terrible odds, there are some additional prizes. Students can win Triton Cash if *some* of their numbers match the corresponding winning numbers, as described in the introduction.
