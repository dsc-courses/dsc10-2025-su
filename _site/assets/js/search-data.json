    "title": "Cells and the Autograder",
    "content": "Why does running a particular cell cause my kernel to die? . If one particular cell seems to cause your kernel to die, your code is probably incorrect in a way that is causing the computer to use more memory than it has available. For instance: your code is trying to create a gigantic array. To prevent from crashing the entire server, the kernel will “die”. This is an indication that there is a mistake in your code that you need to fix. How do I quickly run all the cells in a notebook? . Go to the Cell menu in the top toolbar, then “Run All.” You can also select a certain cell and run all cells before this point, or run all cells after this point. You should run all the cells in your notebook before submitting to confirm that you pass all the tests. Why does grader.check_all() fail, if all previous tests passed? . This can happen if you “overwrite” a variable that is used in a question. For instance, if Question 1 asks you to store your answer in a variable named stat, and later on in the notebook you change the value of stat, you’ll see the test after Question 1 pass, but the test at the end of the notebook fail. Make sure to avoid using the same variable name for more than one purpose. Why does a notebook test fail now, when it passed before and I didn’t change my code? . You probably ran your notebook out of order. Re-run all previous cells in order, which is how your code will be graded. Why did a Gradescope test fail, when all the notebook’s tests passed? . This can happen if you’re running your notebook’s cells out-of-order. The autograder runs your notebook top-to-bottom. If you’re defining a variable at the bottom of your notebook and using it at the top, the Gradescope autograder will fail because it doesn’t recognize the variable when it encounters it. This is why we recommend running Kernel -&gt; Restart and Run All: it “forgets” all of the variables and runs the notebook from top-to-bottom, just like the Gradescope autograder will. This will highlight any issues. Find the first cell that raises an error. Make sure that all of the variables used in that cell have been defined above that cell, and not below. Why do I get an error saying grader is not defined? . If it has been a while since you’ve worked on an assignment, the kernel will shut itself down to preserve memory. When this happens, all of your variables are forgotten, including the grader. That’s OK: you’ll just need to re-run all of the cells. The easiest way to do this is by using Kernel -&gt; Restart and Run All. I’m positive I have the right answer, but the test fails. Is there a mistake in the test? . While you might see the correct answer displayed as the result of the cell, chances are it isn’t being stored in the answer variable. Make sure you are assigning the result to the answer variable. Make sure there are no typos in the variable name. I accidentally deleted something in a cell that was provided to me – how do I get it back? . There are two solutions: . | In this public GitHub repository, you’ll find the “original” versions of all assignments we released this quarter. You can look here and manually add back any necessary code or text that you accidentally deleted. | Suppose you’re working on Lab 5. One solution is go directly to DataHub and rename your lab05 folder to something else, like lab05-old. Then, click the Lab 5 link on the course website again, and it’ll bring you to a brand-new version of Lab 5. Then, you can copy your work from your old Lab 5 to this new one, which should have everything in it. | . I accidentally added something to the grader.check cell in a notebook and I can’t delete it – how do I fix it? . One option is to follow option 2 above, where you rename your assignment folder to something else and click the DataHub link on the course website once again. But, that solution requires you to manually copy and paste your code from your old notebook to your new notebook. There’s another more direct solution – watch this 🎥 video to see how to do it. When I upload my assignment notebook to Gradescope, it says “Otter encountered an error while grading this submission: No gradeable files found in submission” . The most common way this happens is if you (unknowingly) download your notebook as a .json file rather than a .ipynb file. This often happens by default when working on an iPad. One solution, which is also discussed starting at 20:05 in this 🎥 video, is to download your notebook as follows: . | Make sure you’ve restarted your kernel and run all cells in your notebook. Save your notebook. | Click the “JupyterHub” button in the top left corner of the page. | In the file explorer that appears, click dsc10-2024-sp, then navigate to the folder that contains the file you’re trying to download. If you’re working on Homework 3, for instance, you’ll click homeworks and then hw03. | Click the square checkbox to the left of your assignment notebook (e.g. hw03.ipynb). Click “Shutdown” at the top. Then, click the checkbox again and click “Download”. This should download your notebook as a .ipynb file. | . ",

    "content": "A general rule of thumb when debugging is to look at the very last line of an error message. That’s usually the most informative part of the message, and will often tell you directly what’s wrong. isinstance(..., numbers.Integral) . This error is telling you that the answer should be an integer, but your answer is not. This often happens when you’ve done some intermediate work towards the answer and saved an intermediate result in the answer variable instead of the final result. Sometimes instead of isinstance(..., numbers.Integral), you’ll see something like isinstance(..., bpd.DataFrame). This is saying that the answer should be a DataFrame, but yours was something else. The rest of the above still applies. Check the type of your answer variable with type(). Is it what you expected? ... object is not callable . This often happens when you use a default keyword (like str or list) as a variable name, for instance list = [1, 2, 3]. These errors can be tricky because they don’t error on their own, but cause problems when we try to use the name list (for example) later on in the notebook. To fix the issue, identify any such lines of code, change your variable names to be something else, and restart your notebook. Python keywords like str and list appear in green text, so be on the lookout if any of your variable names appear in green! . No module named 'babypandas' . This can happen if you click the name of a course other than DSC 10 when logging into DataHub. Here’s how to “switch” your DataHub to DSC 10 mode: . | Click “Control Panel” in the top right. | Click “Services”, then click “manual-resetter”. | Click “Reset” (if a pop-up box appears, click okay). | Log back into DataHub and it should allow you to select a course again – select DSC 10. | . Other errors . It can be difficult to decipher the meaning of error messages in Python. Here is a useful guide.

    "content": "When I click a link on the course website, I see a black screen with text and a red error bar that says “Error: undefined.” What should I do? . This often happens when clicking multiple assignment or lecture links quickly. Close all of the Jupyter Notebooks you have open, and click links on the course website one at a time. Once one notebook fully loads, click the next link. This error can also occur if you’re using an unsupported internet browser. Make sure you’re using either Chrome, Firefox, or Safari to access DataHub. If you’ve already worked on an assignment and then start seeing this error, try going directly to DataHub (datahub.ucsd.edu) to continue working on your assignment. If all else fails, this issue usually resolves itself with time, so try again in a few hours. When I click a link on the course website, I see a black screen with text and a red error bar. What should I do? . This is usually what’s called a “merge conflict”, which means that DataHub wasn’t able to combine the versions of the assignments we released with the versions you worked on. This should only happen in rare circumstances. 🚨 Warning! There are several errors that look similar to the image above, but before proceeding carefully read the error message to ensure that it contains the phrase “Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge”. If this is not present in the error message, contact us on Ed with a screenshot. If you do see the above phrase, continue with the steps below. | Go directly to DataHub (datahub.ucsd.edu). You should be taken to a “File Manager” view which lists the folders available in your account. | On the upper right of the page, click the dropdown menu that says “New” and select “Terminal”. | In the terminal, type cd dsc10-2024-sp, then hit the enter key to run it. The command will not display anything. | Still in the terminal, type git stash, at which point your terminal window should look like the one below. Then, hit enter to run the command. You should see some output. | Finally, go back to dsc10.com and click the link to the assignment you were attempting to work on. It should now load without error. If you still see an error, make a post on Ed with a screenshot of the error you see now. | . Why can’t I log in to DataHub? . Log out of all Google accounts or open an incognito window. When prompted, enter your full UCSD email, username@ucsd.edu, as your credentials. How can Extension Students access DataHub? . Extension students may receive separate accounts for the purpose of accessing DataHub. To look up your account information and reset any additional account passwords, visit this website and enter your AX account in the username field and your UID in the Student ID field (e.g. “axNNNN”, “cs120sp20aa”, etc.) . My notebook won’t load. Is DataHub down? . Sometimes DataHub does have availability issues. Usually it is back up and running again within an hour. In other instances, there are some things you can do to get the notebook running again: Make sure your internet connection is working. If you can, restart your server by clicking the button at the top right labeled “Control Panel”, then select “Stop My Server”, followed by “Start My Server”. If that doesn’t work, try restarting your computer and using a different browser. Whenever you resume working on a notebook, run all cells you’ve previously completed. If your problem persists after trying all these steps, please notify us on Ed. What if I don’t have access to DataHub and I still want to access DSC 10 materials? . We welcome the general public to use our materials. If you’re not enrolled in the class, you can access all lectures and assignments in our public GitHub repository.

In particular, you should not split up the project and each work on separate parts independently. You and your partner will receive the same score on any submissions you make together.

What makes pair programming effective is that both programmers are working together on the same problem at the same time. Research shows that the resulting work of pair programming nearly always outshines that of the solitary programmer, with pairs producing better code in less time.

    "title": "Choosing a Partner",
    "content": "You can choose your own partner. You will need to arrange times to meet outside of class. We expect everyone to be flexible and professional in arranging those times as necessary; if your schedule is highly constrained, explore possible meeting times with your prospective partner before you commit to the partnership. You should try to pick a partner whose experience and skill level with programming is similar to your own. This may not always be possible and it is sometimes hard to compare skill levels, but students tell us (and other data supports) that pairs are most productive when the partners start at about the same level. Still, people often pair up with another whose skills are different. This happens more often than not, as no two people have an identical skill set. The differences may be great or small, but this is exactly like most real-world working situations. Part of accomplishing a task is to get the most out of each member and make each member stronger and more productive on subsequent tasks. Students bring different strengths to the process, regardless of how much experience they have had with programming. Both experienced and inexperienced students will need to draw on their reasoning and problem solving skills. A more experienced partner may sometimes feel frustrated or slowed down by a less experienced partner, but the experienced partner still benefits from the teamwork in many ways. The less experienced partner’s requests for clarification often uncover flaws in an approach or solution; the exercise of providing a clear explanation solidifies and deepens the explainer’s own understanding and the teamwork and communication skills they gain have great value in both the academic realm and the job market. “My partner had never coded anything before so I was able to teach him a little bit about how it worked. The teaching bit helped me a lot withunderstanding the labs and passing the exams.” – student . The less experienced partner may feel that their questions hold the other partner back or that there is no benefit to participating actively, but pair programming studies show that paired work is consistently better than work the stronger partner does alone. It is each partner’s job to understand the whole task; that means asking questions when necessary and answering them when possible. ",

If that approach is not successful, explain the issues to the instructors, who will work with you and your partner to improve the situation.

    "content": "Welcome to DSC 10 at UC San Diego! This course aims to teach you how to draw conclusions about data. We will learn how to explore data and make predictions using data. Programming is a useful tool to help us analyze large datasets, and so we will learn how to program in Python towards this goal. We will learn some of the core techniques of data science, and we will practice applying them to real datasets from a variety of different disciplines. Prerequisites: None. This course is an introduction to data science with no prior background assumed beyond high school algebra. Make sure you are well-prepared by taking this pretest. If you are not planning on entering the DSC major/minor and have already taken a programming class and a statistics class, you may wish to take a more advanced course. If you are a DSC major/minor, DSC 10 is absolutely required, as later courses heavily reference its specific content. Acknowledgements . The contents of this course come from UC Berkeley’s Data 8 course, created by Ani Adhikari, John DeNero, and many others. This offering builds off of earlier offerings of DSC 10 by Justin Eldridge, Suraj Rampure, Janine Tiefenbruck, and many others. Thanks to all those who have a played a role in shaping this amazing course! . ",

    "content": "Lecture . There is one lecture section: . | MTuWF 9:30AM-10:50AM in CSB 005. The Zoom room is here and you must be logged onto Zoom via your UCSD credentials to join. There is also a password which was emailed you to at the start of the term. | . Lecture is meant to introduce you to the main concepts of the course. Attendance either on Zoom or in-person accounts for a 2% participation grade. In order to get the 2%, you must attend at least 14 lectures throughout the term. If you fill out the pre-course survey before 07/02, you need to attend 13 lectures throughout the term. There is no partial credit for the participation grade. It is strongly encouraged to attend all lectures as you’ll get the opportunity to ask questions, answer ungraded concept-check polls, and participate in discussion. We’re going to move very fast in this summer offering of DSC 10—twice as fast as the regular class—so if you miss a lecture, it may be quite challenging to catch up. Lectures will be podcasted (UCSD’s term for “recorded”). Podcast recordings will be available directly on the course homepage; you can access these by clicking the podcast button with the 🎥 emoji. In the Schedule of Classes, this course is listed as having both a discussion section (DI) and a lab section (LA), but we will only have one weekly meeting outside of lecture for oral quizzes which we will elaborate on below. Quizzes . All students enrolled are also assigned to both a lab section (1PM-3PM) and a discussion section (3PM-5PM) on Monday (listed as LA and DI on the Schedule of Classes). However, instead of using the Monday 1PM-5PM block of the schedule for lab/discussion sections, we will be having 4 oral quizzes in this course. They make up 8% of your grade and are pass/fail. | You will meet with either Sam or Ashley for 5 minutes each Monday starting Week 2. Sign up for times here and indicate whether you will be on zoom or in-person. To get through all students, we have blocked out 1PM-3:30PPM for oral quizzes. From 3:30PM-5:00PM, Sam plans on holding office hours online. | We will ask one question about topics covered in the previous week. | You can make mistakes while answering and still pass! The important thing is for us to hear your thought process for problem solving. | . Office Hours . In order to provide you with help on assignments and concepts, the course staff will hold several office hours throughout the week, both in-person and on Zoom. See the Calendar tab of the course website for the most up-to-date schedule and instructions. We use the term “office hours” but really, office hours are held in a common room or on Zoom where you can come to work on assignments, meet your classmates, and get help from course staff. We don’t bite and we would love to see you in office hours! . Office hours are your chance to ask for general help, clarification on assignments, and to review previous assignments. Our tutors have previously taken the class, done well, and been trained in how to help you. Course staff will not tell you if your answer is correct, and it is inappropriate to ask. Here are some really good questions to ask instead: . | I got confused about a concept in class. Can you explain it? | When the assignment says X, does it mean A or B? | My code is giving a weird error - can you help me understand why? | I can’t get this test to pass, so I must be doing something wrong. Can you help me figure it out? | My code is doing something different than what I expected. Can you explain what is happening? | . Questions that you should never ask a tutor: . | Is this the right answer? | Can you check my code and make sure it is right? | What is the answer? | What’s going to be on the exam? | . Your primary motivation when interacting with course staff should be learning. ",

    "content": "Technology . First and foremost, you will need access to a computer (or tablet with a keyboard) and a stable internet connection to participate in this course. UCSD has a Laptop Lending Program which may be helpful, but you should also contact us if you have any concerns about access to technology. Most students bring a computer to lecture, and a computer or tablet will be necessary for discussion sections. All course content will be linked from this website, but there are a few additional platforms that you’ll need to access: . | Campuswire: We’ll be using Campuswire as our course message and discussion board. More details are in the Communication section below. If you didn’t already get an invitation, join here. | Gradescope: You’ll submit all assignments and exams to Gradescope. This is where all of your grades will live as well. You will be automatically added to Gradescope. | DataHub: Assignments in this course will involve programming in Python. DataHub (datahub.ucsd.edu) is UCSD’s online data science and machine learning platform, where you will work on assignments. We will show you how to use it in class. | . Make sure you can access all three sites ASAP. It’s a good idea to bookmark them, too (though they’re all linked at the top of this website). Sam will be available Monday Week 1 during our lab/discussion block in HDSI 432 (for those of you in-person) and on Zoom (for those of you online). Note that we will not be using Canvas this quarter. You won’t see this course on your Canvas at all. In addition, please do not contact the staff through Canvas – we won’t be able to read it! . Welcome Survey . Please fill out this short welcome survey at the start of quarter. This is required of all students. Pretest . DSC 10’s only prerequisite is high school algebra. In order to gauge your preparedness for the type of math you’ll see in this class, you should work through the practice problems on this pretest. You will not submit this pretest, and it will not be graded, but it will help you identify any gaps in your background knowledge and it will teach you some useful test-taking skills. We’ll release solutions to the pretest on Wednesday of Week 1. ",

    "title": "🧪 Assignments",
    "content": "Lab Assignments . Weekly lab assignments are a required part of the course and will help you develop fluency in Python and working with data. The labs are designed to help you build the skills you need to complete homework assignments and projects in a low-stress setting. As you complete the lab, you’ll be able to run a sequence of autograder tests, which check to make sure that your answers are correct. If you complete the assignment and all the tests pass, you’ll get a perfect score! . To submit a lab, follow the instructions in the assignment to upload your notebook to Gradescope, which will run automated tests and assign your score. You should verify that all of your test cases pass on Gradescope before the deadline. We will release lab assignments roughly a week before they’re due. Your lowest lab score is dropped from your grade calculation at the end of the quarter. Labs must be completed and submitted individually, but we encourage you to discuss high-level approaches with others. See the Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity section for more details. Homework Assignments . Weekly homework assignments build off of the skills you have developed in labs. Homeworks will reinforce concepts from class, explore new ideas, and provide hands-on experience working with data. An important difference between labs and homeworks lies in the way autograder tests are run. Unlike the tests in the labs, the tests in the homework cannot be used to guarantee that you have the correct answers. The tests in the homework only check to make sure that your answer is appropriately formatted, not that it is correct. For example, if a homework question asks you to calculate a percent, the test in the homework might check that the answer you provide is a number between 0 and 100. You should make sure that all the tests pass before submitting your homework, but this will not guarantee a perfect score. After you submit your homework to Gradescope, and after the deadline for submissions has passed, a new set of hidden tests will be run to make sure that you have the correct answers. In the percent example above, the hidden test might check that your answer equals 56, for example. Your score for the assignment will be based on the results of the hidden tests, which won’t be available immediately after submission. So if you see a perfect score upon submission, this only means that you’ve passed the formatting tests, not the hidden correctness tests that determine your score. To submit a homework, follow the instructions in the assignment to upload your notebook to Gradescope. We will release homework assignments roughly a week before they’re due. Your lowest homework score is dropped from your grade calculation at the end of the quarter. Like labs, homeworks must be completed and submitted individually, but we encourage you to discuss high-level approaches with others. See the Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity section for more details. Projects . This class has a final project. Projects are like more challenging homeworks. They are longer than a typical homework, and they require you to pull together ideas from previous weeks, rather than just the last week. Projects also give you a chance to explore a dataset in-depth, which can be a lot of fun! . Project autograder tests are like homework autograder tests – the provided tests only check if your answers have the correct format, not if they are correct. You’ll only be able to see your score on the project after the deadline, once all projects are submitted and the hidden correctness tests have been run. Unlike labs and homeworks, you may work with a partner on projects. Your partner can be anyone else in any section of the course. If you choose to work with a partner, start by reading these project partner guidelines. If working with a partner, only one of you should submit the assignment, and you’ll be able to tag your partner in your Gradescope submission. Deadlines . Labs, homeworks, and projects must be submitted by 11:59PM on the due date to be considered on time. You may turn them in as many times as you like before the deadline, and only the most recent submission will be graded, so it’s a good habit to submit early and often. When submitting any assignment to Gradescope, make sure to stick around until you see a confirmation that all tests have passed. If the Gradescope autograder cannot grade your work or you see a message saying “Your submission timed out,” this indicates an error with your code, and it is your responsibility to identify and solve the problem before the deadline. It may take some time for Gradescope’s autograder to grade your submission. You are encouraged to submit with enough time to see the output of the autograder before the 11:59PM deadline, as it may alert you to a problem you need to fix. However, if you submit before 11:59PM and the autograder finishes running after 11:59PM, your assigment will still be considered on time. After submitting, check that you got a confirmation email from Gradescope to verify that your submission was successful. Save this email until you receive your grade on the assignment, in case of any issues with your submission. Assignments may be submitted up to 2 days late, with a 5% penalty per day (e.g. a submission 1 day late is capped at 95%, 2 days late at 90%). Submissions more than 2 days late will not be accepted without an approved extension. Extension requests will be granted on a case-by-case basis; please email Sam directly (sac003@ucsd.edu) as soon as possible once you know that you may need an extension. The earlier we know that something has come up, the more we can help support you. Submission Errors . It is your responsibility to ensure that your work is submitted correctly to Gradescope as a .ipynb file. Watch 20:05 and onwards of this video to see two ways of downloading Jupyter notebooks as a .ipynb file. When submitting your work, there are two potential errors to watch out for: . | Submitting your notebook in the wrong format, e.g. submitting as a .json or .txt file instead of a .ipynb file. If you do this, the Gradescope autograder will not be able to grade your work, and you will get a 0. This can almost certainly be avoided by watching the aforementioned video, and by waiting until you see confirmation from Gradescope that all tests have passed. | Submitting the wrong notebook, e.g. submitting your Lab 6 notebook to the Homework 6 assignment on Gradescope. This will also give you a 0, because the Gradescope autograder for a particular assignment can only grade your work for that assignment. To avoid this error, make sure to stick around on Gradescope after submission until you see that all tests have passed. | . To prevent these issues, it is important that you (1) double-check that you are submitting the right notebook in the right format to Gradescope, and (2) let the autograder run on Gradescope until it shows you under “Public Tests” that all public test cases passed. If you happen to make one of the above mistakes and you notice it yourself within 48 hours of the deadline, please resubmit your assignment. If it is more than 48 hours since the deadline, please reach out to a staff member and we may resubmit for you, which will cost you 2 slip days. It is your responsibility to ensure that all assignments are submitted correctly. ",

    "title": "🤝 Academic Integrity Policies",
    "content": "The basic rule for DSC 10 is: Work hard. Make use of the expertise of the staff to learn what you need to know to really do well in the course. Act with integrity, and don’t cheat. If you do cheat, we will enforce the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship. This means you will likely fail the course and the Dean of your college will put you on probation or suspend or dismiss you from UCSD. Students agree that by taking this course, their assignments will be submitted to third party software to help detect plagiarism. Why is academic integrity important? . Academic integrity is an issue that is pertinent to all students on campus. When students act unethically by copying someone’s work, taking an exam for someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades (and for the University to give degrees) that reflect student knowledge. This devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it imperative for the campus as a whole to enforce that all members of this community are honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD! . The UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and this syllabus list some of the standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations. What counts as cheating? . In DSC 10, you can read books, surf the web, talk to your friends and the DSC 10 staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete your assignments. However, no other person should complete your work for you or write any of the code you submit in this course, with the exception of the work you do with a project partner. The following activities are considered cheating and are not allowed in DSC 10 (not an exhaustive list): . | Using or submitting code acquired from other individuals. | Posting your code online, including on Ed, unless privately to instructors only. | Having any other person complete any part of your assignment on your behalf. | Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else. | Providing code, exam questions, or solutions to any other student in the course. | Splitting up project questions with your project partner and each working on different questions. | Collaborating with others on quizzes or exams. | . The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and are allowed in DSC 10 (not an exhaustive list): . | Discussing the general approach to solving homework problems or projects. | Talking about problem-solving strategies or issues you ran into and how you solved them. | Discussing the answers to quizzes or exams once all students in all sections of the course have taken the assessment. | Using code provided in class or in any assigned readings or videos. | Google searching for documentation on Python or babypandas. | Working together with other students on assignments without copying or sharing answers. | Posting a question about your approach to a problem on Ed, without sharing your code. | . The best way to avoid problems is by using your best judgment and remembering to act with Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility, and Courage. Here are some suggestions for completing your work: . | Don’t look at or discuss the details of another student’s code for an assignment you are working on, and don’t let another student look at your code. | Don’t start with someone else’s code and make changes to it, or in any way share code with other students. | If you are talking to another student about an assignment, don’t take notes, and wait an hour afterward before you write any code. | . Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence . Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) describes tools, such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, that are trained to generate responses to user-defined prompts, or questions. The existence of such tools is a major milestone in machine learning, and an impressive application of data science in the real world. Our course policy on the use of GenAI tools for coursework is simple: you may use these tools to build an understanding of course material and to assist you on assignments, keeping in mind that no tool is a substitute for a strong understanding of course concepts. Be mindful of how you are using GenAI tools. These tools can be very useful to help you preview material before lecture, summarize material after lecture, explain concepts you didn’t understand, and explore how different concepts are related. “Explain it like I’m five” can be a helpful prompt to give you a basic understanding of new concepts before being exposed to them in lecture. Consolidating your knowledge after learning something new and relating it to other things you know is important for learning and retention. Unfortunately, GenAI tools are not a consistently reliable source of quality information. For example, we asked ChatGPT to tell us about the Central Limit Theorem, an idea we will learn about towards the end of the quarter. The answer we get back is actually quite good. Good answer, ChatGPT! However, we also asked ChatGPT to tell us about permutation testing, another idea from the second half of the quarter. The answer we got back was wrong in very subtle ways, though it might sound correct to someone learning about permutation testing for the first time. Thinking about why ChatGPT’s answer is wrong is a useful learning exercise. Not quite... As this example illustrates, be skeptical about anything you learn from GenAI tools. Because of how GenAI tools are trained, they are designed to provide answers that sound correct, not necessarily ones that are correct. A goal of your education is to develop an ability to identify and produce information that actually is correct and doesn’t just sound correct. Human supervision of GenAI tools is always necessary. In addition, proceed with caution when using tools to assist you with your assignments. DSC 10 is a foundational class for your study of data science; you need to master the skills and concepts of this course if you want to use data science effectively. Through quizzes and exams, you will be tested on your independent ability to apply course material to novel problems. Homeworks, labs, and projects are meant to prepare you for these assessments, so overreliance on GenAI for assignments will rob you of opportunities to learn and make it hard for you to perform well on assessments. If you do use GenAI to assist you on assignments, keep these guidelines in mind: . | Design your prompts carefully. Don’t just ask one question; ask a follow-up question based on the output to the first. To use these tools effectively, you need to engineer your prompts carefully. Here are some tips for crafting prompts. | Test the outputs. GenAI tools can and do make mistakes, and being able to verify the correctness of a proposed answer is an important skill for you to develop. Validate the output against course-provided references, or follow up with a search on Google or Stack Overflow. Remember that GenAI tools provide crowdsourced likely answers, not necessarily correct answers. | Don’t submit any code that you don’t understand, or that uses content not taught in this class. In this introductory course, we expose you to a limited set of Python tools that you can use to solve a wide range of problems. When you prompt a GenAI tool with a question from DSC 10, it will not be limited to our restricted toolkit, and may provide answers using much more complicated code. If you answer questions with out-of-scope content, you are not practicing the foundational skills that the course is meant to teach you. In addition, your code may not pass correctness tests that require your solution to use methods taught in the course. | . If your assignment submission includes any content generated by an AI tool, it should be cited to acknowledge the source of the material. At the end of each assignment, you will be provided with a space to explain and reflect on your use of GenAI tool(s). ",
