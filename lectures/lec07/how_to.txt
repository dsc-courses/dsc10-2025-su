Make edits as needed to lec11.ipynb.

In lec11.ipynb, go to File, Download as Reveal .js slides (.slides.html).

Put the .slides.html file back in the lec11 folder (so that it's in the same folder as rise.css, for formatting).

Open lec11.slides.html in a text editor and add the line <link rel="stylesheet" href="rise.css" id="theme"> under <!-- General and theme style sheets -->, in addition to whatever is currently there.

Open lec11.slides.html by clicking on it and opening it in a web broswer, then print to PDF (landscape orientation, 90% size so the content always fits). This part does not work on Janine's computer for some reason.

On the website, post blank slides.

After lecture, post link to solutions notebook in Datahub and annotated slides.
